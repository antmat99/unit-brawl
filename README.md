# unit-brawl

Unit Brawl is a gamified application meant to manage multiple rounds, each one consisting of players developing Java programs and unit tests to be executed on each other. The players collect points by writing correct code that does not make the other players' test cases fail, or by writing test cases capable of detecting defects in the other players' code.
